Main research objectives of the study are to **determine**:

~~What is the incremental impact on integration, health insurance enrollment, access to healthcare services, morbidity and mortality from the Estatuto Temporal de Proteccion para Migrantes (ETPMV) regulation implemented in February 2021 for Venezuelan women and their children?~~

What are the health system **enablers** and **barriers** to the enrollment process for Venezuelan migrants (ETPMV and health insurance enrollment)?

To achieve these objectives, thus far we completed:

Estrategias

1. data collection on our **four** telephone survey instruments (general health, ante-natal care, post-natal care and child health surveys) which are the main method of data collection, and have begun cleaning and analyzing the data. We have worked with in-country partners (Iquartil and University of Los Andes) to complete survey implementation and data collection.
2. We have also completed secondary data collection for the municipal integration index that will classify all municipalities in Colombia with regard to level of integration of Venezuelan migrants and have begun developing a digital narrative using this data.

_At this point in project progress, all data collection is complete. Final analysis review and write up are in development. Final stakeholder engagement meetings and sessions will occur in the fall._
